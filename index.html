          Hello and welcome to my page! Below, I have visually and descriptively elaborated on the highlights from my solo trip to
          Indonesia in 2015. Over the course of 10 weeks, I travelled throughout the islands of Bali, the Gilis, Komodo, Flores,
          Sulawesi, Irian Jaya (West Papua). From exotic wildlife to former cannibals, I experienced one of the greatest trips in
          my life.

          <p>After a short stay visiting the diving village of Amed in Bali and the infamous Gili Trawangan, I made my way by
          three-day boat ride to Komodo Island. Every tourist package that offers this trip continues on from Komodo Island to the
          adjacent Flores. However, due to my interest in reptiles and since it had always been a dream of mine to see wild Komodo
          dragons, I arranged to stay with my guide in Komodo Village. There are no hotels on the island and only one small
          homestay (with minimal amenities), so this was the best option I had. As it turned out, I had found myself a pretty cool
          family to stay with while I soaked in the island for a week.

          <p>Since there is barely any infrastructure on the island (there is one village and the tourist center), I took up hiking.
          Komodo dragons are capable of killing people, so I was only allowed to explore the island with a guide. However, that
          only enhanced my experience as I was shown dragon nests (giant mounds of dirt), endemic blue pit vipers, baby dragons
          hiding in trees (dragons are cannibals), and the mystifying Pink Beach.

          <p>After satiating a lifelong aspiration to see the dragons, I made my way to Labuan Bajo, Flores. Although I was leaving
          Komodo National Park, it was only temporary. In addition to the exotic wildlife that Komodo is known for, it also has
          some of the best scuba diving in the world. Despite just getting my diving license, I have been diving since as early as
          4, when my dad would sink his tank and BCD into our home pool. As excited as I was about seeing the dragons, I also came
          to see the diving. Over the three days, I made 9 dives. In terms of animals, I was able to see over 50+ manta rays (I
          lost count..), a flamboyant cuttlefish, countless sharks (blacktips, whitetips, and occasionally greytips), pygmy
          seahorses, many turtles (hawksbill and green) and nudibranchs. The actual dives themselves were amazing. They included a
          sky-diving like dive at Crystal Rock, where you had to immediately dive straight down to 30 meters and grab onto a rock
          because the current was so strong. My favorite dive was The Cauldron, which blows you on a current between two islands.
          After the shotgun-like drift, your view expands to an endless landscape of moving soft coral. There were other great
          dives too - you’ll have to ask me about them if you’re curious!

              <p>After finally having enough of Komodo and Labuan Bajo, I set off to explore Flores. Serendipitously, I met a trio of two
              Germans and a Spaniard, and we all decided to hire a driver together as we wanted to see the village of Wae Rebo (as
              seen to the left and above). Wae Rebo was an amazing experience. After hiking for five hours through a legitimate jungle, we arrived at
              the village high up in the mountains. We were greeted by the kindest of elderly people - some were said to be over one
              hundred years old! After having coffee and taking in the calmness of the isolation, we hiked back down. After Wae Rebo,
              we checked out a few other villages. Due to their ease of access, none of them quite had the magnificence of the famous
              mountain village.

              <p>As we traveled along the single road on Flores, we saw a ton of greenery. There were many long expanses of switchbacks,
              so we decided to break up the trip. The first place we stayed was at the junction town of Ruteng. Although Ruteng
              doesn’t have quite the appeal of some of Flores’s other attractions, there are these amazing spider web rice fields,
              which we spent a little while viewing from an adjacent mountain ridge. After Ruteng, we visited Kelimutu National Park,
              where the photo to the right was taken. The park is famous for having three lakes with different colors: blue, sky-blue,
              and red. These color anomalies are due to sulfur and algae. Seeing the sunrise above the three lakes may just have been
              worth waking up at 4 am...

              <p>Before my three friends and I saw the three colored lakes, we visited the 17 Islands National Park in the coastal
              village of Riung. The islands all had picturesque white sand beaches (as seen on the right), and we had a great time
              island hopping for a day. In addition to a lot of lounging and having a king fish barbeque, we were also taken to see a
              large colony of flying foxes. The day trip out to see the islands of Riung was something I don’t think I will ever
              forget.

              <p>After eventually getting from the three lakes of Kelimutu to the far eastern city of Maumere, I took a massive public
              transport ship to the port city of Makassar in southwestern Sulawesi. After an overnight stay in the city, I took a bus
              to Tana Toraja. Toraja is one of the most stunning places I’ve ever seen, with its tremendous green rice fields and
              position in a valley. The real draw, however, were the famous funerals that are endemic to the region. The funeral
              ceremonies themselves are massive feasts, with the coffin and entire makeshift buildings ornately decorated. There were
              also many animal sacrifices of pigs and water buffalo. The people of Toraja believe that these animals will go with the
              deceased to the afterlife, and cherish white, blue-eyed water buffalo above all. After a humbling experience, I went to
              see the famous graves (as seen to the left). The graves are carved into the side of a mountain, and their facades are
              decorated with effigies of their relatives. Although initially very strange, I found these unique graves extremely
              fascinating.

              <p>After the funeral I attended, I was shown another treasure of Toraja. Throughout the area, there are numerous
              traditional houses (as seen to the right). These houses, with their iconic boat style roofs, are characteristic of the
              culture. And by some crazy chance, I happened to be checking out the most famous and ancient houses at the same time as
              the winner of Indonesia’s first American Idol winner, Joy Tobing (pictures to the right).

              <p>After taking in the humbling funeral in Tana Toraja, I took two twenty-four hour bus rides, back to back. Although there
              are the Togian Islands in the giant bay in the north of the island and the endemic babirusa boars, I decided to go
              directly to the very tip of the top finger of Sulawesi. This area was one of the main attractions for me to come to
              Indonesia, as it has some of the best diving in the world and the smallest primate in the world, the tarsier (whose eyes
              are bigger than its brain). After arriving in the coastal city of Manado, I was shocked with how expensive the diving
              was. Fortunately, I was able to connect with the workers at Thalassa Dive Resort, and was able to make seven dives in
              Bunaken National Park. The dives themselves were spectacular, and the most famous sites were wall dives. Sadly, there
              was a lot of trash in the water and in the reefs. We were able to see many of the same animals as I had seen in Komodo,
              and even attempted a dive to see dugongs (sadly, they weren’t there). As I reflect back on my relaxing time diving and
              enjoying the chill vibe of the Manado people, I truly hope that I will be able to return one day.

              <p>After two weeks of enjoying Manado, I decided that I needed another place to visit. When I travel, I research the places
              that interest me the most, but I do not make a set plan on where to go. One of the longshot ideas I had when looking
              into making my fourth trip to Indonesia was going to the island of Papua. Many people have heard about the eastern side
              of the island, the nation of Papua New Guinea. However, what I had not initially heard of was that the western half is
              also very interesting. Thanks to the insight and a plane ticket from my father, I flew to the western part of the
              island. After spending a night in Sorong for pure necessity (it is the entry point into the island), I flew to the
              Baliem Valley, an interior region of the island known for its headhunter history.

              <p>The Baliem Valley was visually stunning. The floor of the valley was truly flat and was surrounded by mountain ranges
              that seemed to just shoot out of the ground. After a day of exploring some caves and seeing the countryside, I was taken
              to see the traditional people. Besides a gourd or skirt for men and women respectively, the people were essentially
              naked. However, they were all adorned with beautiful feather crowns (which you can see me wearing to the right). After
              befriending a rather friendly local (the image to the top left), I was given a private tour throughout the village.
              There, I was taken into the chief's hut, and was later shown the prized possession of the village, a 300 year old mummy.

              <p>The last place I saw in the Baliem Valley (and Irian Jaya, at least until 2018) was another local village. My guide
              happened to know of a funeral going on, and he invited me to go as the only foreigner in attendance. I was instructed to
              hand out cigarettes as offerings, and was able to see how the locals held funerals. To my surprise, the body was
              initially sat in a chair in one of the huts, where many people were crying. The body was later cremated out in the open,
              and the hosts cooked pig in the same leaves that were used for the cremation.

              <p>My trip was tied to my plane ticket, a roundtrip ticket from San Francisco to Bali. I thus made my way back to the Hindu
              island. Bali has always had a special place in my heart. In 2000, 2001, and 2003, my family took trips to the island.
              Although my dad says that he hesitated back then because it was already too built up and ruined, those trips were some
              of my favorite times.The first trip in particular was amazing. I had never seen a place so exotic but with such nice
              people. I will always remember the locals always waving at us saying bula as we drove by in our white, seatbeltless
              Kijang.

              <p>My short return to Bali was highlighted by my time with the Bali Wildlife Rescue. By paying a relatively small fee, the
              group showed me an incredible range of animals. They even introduced me to their 15 ft king cobra, which I even kissed…
              and held! After seeing flying foxes in Riung, holding one was a cool experience.

              <p>In addition to king cobras and a flying fox, I also was able to hold a juvenile saltwater crocodile (without tape around
              its mouth) and a pangolin. I had never heard of a pangolin before, but it quickly became one of my favorite animals.
              They are amazingly cute animals, but their claws tend to scratch you. Having the experience of seeing all of these
              animals gave my trip full of scuba, indigenous people and exotic places the perfect cap. SInce this trip, I have gone
              back to Indonesia once with my father to again dive in Komodo National Park, and also Raja Ampat, arguably the best reef
              in the world.
